        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Jeena Anandita, a passionate pre-final year student majoring in web development. My journey into programming began with HTML and CSS, and I've since expanded my skills to include JavaScript. I'm also familiar with Python, Java, C, and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Currently, I'm gaining practical experience through the Software Engineering program at J.P. Morgan via the Forage app. Outside of academics, I thrive in competitive environments, having participated in hackathons and coding contests, where I enjoy applying my problem-solving abilities. I'm driven by a desire to build meaningful projects that contribute positively to the web development community.</p>
